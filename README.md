<a name="setup"></a>
## ðŸ”¥ Setting up and running the app locally

1. Fork the repo
   - First, you have to make your own copy of the project. For that, you have to fork the repository.You can find the fork button on the top-right side of the browser window.(Refer to the image below.)
   - Kindly wait till it gets forked.
   - After that copy, it will look like "your-user-name/Swetify-Music" forked from "ShwetKhatri2001/Swetify-Music"
  
2. Clone the repo to your system
    - Now you have your own copy of the project. Here, you have to start your work.
    - Go to the desired location on your computer where you want to set up the project.
    - Open that location on your terminal and clone the repo using the commands given below.
  
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Swetify-Music.git
    ```
    ```
    cd Swetify-Music
    ``` 
3. To get the web app up and running, you need to open the `index.html` in the browser.
   To make your development process more convenient I'd recommend to use [Live Server on VS Code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-enable-live-server-on-visual-studio-code/)
